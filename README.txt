This script's inteded behaviour is that it copies all files from the given directory and it's subdirectories to folders named after their extensions. Presonally I find it useful especially for clearing old nested backup directories, which contents where forgotten long ago:)










It seems to be working well for me, HOWEVER, I dont't guarantee anything:)
